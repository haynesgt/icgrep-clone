The two scripts in this folder will aggregate all the data that perf.py produces and then makes images for the tests that are in perf.py.

1) First aggregate the data in order by running format.py:
	python format.py "fileNameHere" "svn revision here"
This will append the data provided to the end of the data that is already stored.

2) Second call plot.py to make the pngs.
	python plot.py
This will look at the aggregate data files (geotracking.json and performancetracking.json) and generate graphs.
Cycles and Instructions graphs will be made for individual tests that are inside perf.py over time.
Also 2 summary geometric-mean graphs will be made for cycles and instructions for ALL the tests inside perf.py.

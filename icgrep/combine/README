This is the automated combinatorial testing too for icGrep.

Requirement: ICU4C to compile ugrep for differential.

To set up:
(1) cd to icgrep-build directory.
(2) run 

$ g++ -std=c++11 -o ugrep ../icgrep/ugrep.cpp `pkg-config --libs --cflags icu-uc icu-io` 

to create ugrep for differential testing

(3) run setup.sh from icgrep-build:
$ ../icgrep/combine/setup.sh
(4) run “./core —help” for usage.

Analysis:
In core-out/bugs there would be a file named bugList where all bugs are logged.
the folders regs and files contain the reg and files named based on the test number.

Note: CoRE currently works on revision 5742 of icgrep. You can compile CoRE and then update icgrep to test the latest version.
